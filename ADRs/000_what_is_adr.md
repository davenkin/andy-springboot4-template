## Context

Why a decision is needed?

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with
its context and consequences.

For each ADR, please write a separate file in the `ADRs` directory, using the format `[000]_[name_of_the_adr].md`, where
`000` is the sequential number.

## Decision

What is the decision and why we choose it?

## Implementation

This section is optional. It documents the details of how to implement the chosen decision. It should provide enough
information for new team members to quickly understand and adopt the decision, best with code examples.
